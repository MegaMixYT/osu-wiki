## Rules

- **By submitting your artwork to this contest, you grant Project Loved permission to use your artwork should it win, and to use it in promotional material for both the game (osu!) and Project Loved.** You retain all rights to your creation and you can sell it and distribute it however you like — it is your work, after all. We're just saying here that if you submit your piece to this contest, you should be okay with us using it.
- **All entries MUST be suitable for all-ages viewing.** Keep your submission G-rated and safe-for-work to let everything stay nice and cute!
- **SUBMIT ONLY YOUR OWN WORK. REDRAWING AND COMPOSITE WORKS ARE NOT ALLOWED.** Plagiarism sucks. Don't do it. Someone in the comments will call you out for it as has happened every other time someone's tried and they're going to do more damage to your reputation than us removing your entry from the voting will do. Use only your own work — brushes and the like are fine, but that's it! Don't redraw someone else's work.
- **AI art generation methods are not allowed.** This includes any kind of software that has you supply a written or visual prompt and fills in large amounts of details for you, and features in software like Adobe's generative fill, etc. We also acknowledge that this stuff is everywhere now and we have *science* employed to help detect it.
- **Artist attribution (names, social media handles, etc.) must be limited to no more than three lines total and confined to either the bottom left or bottom right corners of your entry.** Being proud of your work is good, just do it in a reasonably small spot of your work. One thing unique to osu!'s history is that we really don't like forced advertisement, and attribution that is too large can come across like it.
- **A full concept must be submitted and present on the artwork.** This includes name, date of birth, approximate height and weight, and a general outline of their personality and hobbies.
*As a final note, please be aware that the administration reserves the right to request and/or make alterations to the winning entry.*

When you're ready to submit your piece, head on over to the [Project Loved Mascot Contest listing](link_to_be_added) and drag-drop your entry into the box with the big fat plus sign (+) in it. You can delete and resubmit your entry at any time before the contest closes and voting starts. Perfect if you're like every other artist in existence who sees something minutely wrong with their work that they somehow missed in the ten hours it just took them to make the thing.
